Components Used: 
Arduino Uno, ESP32, Joystick Module, Touch Sensor, Servo Motor, 
LCD Display (I2C, 16x2), Twilio API, Jumper Wires, Breadboard.


ðŸ”§ How It Works
ESP32 (Pattern Generator + SMS Sender)
Connects to WiFi and generates a random pattern (3â€“5 joystick directions) and required number of touches (2â€“5).

Sends the pattern and touch count to:

The Arduino Uno via Serial (pins D4 and D5).

A mobile number via Twilio SMS API.

Sends only once at startup and remains idle afterward.

Arduino Uno (Pattern Verifier + Lock Controller)
Receives the pattern and touch count from ESP32.

Waits for the user to:

Touch the sensor the specified number of times.

Input the correct joystick pattern (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT).

On successful match:

Unlocks a servo motor (e.g., for a physical lock).

Displays status on a 16x2 I2C LCD.

Automatically resets after unlocking to be ready for a new pattern.



Well it's not completed yet the device will not be able to lock 
if possible lock the device by doing some touches in the touch sensor


See ya'll
